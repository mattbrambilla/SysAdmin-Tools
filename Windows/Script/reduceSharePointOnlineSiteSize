To reduce the size of a SharePoint site using PowerShell, follow these steps:

1. **Connect to SharePoint Online:**
   - Open **Windows PowerShell ISE** on your system.
   - Run the following command to connect to SharePoint Online (replace the placeholders with your actual SharePoint tenant name and user credentials):
     ```powershell
     Connect-SPOService -Url "https://your-tenant.sharepoint.com" -Credential "your-username@your-tenant.onmicrosoft.com"
     ```
   - Enter your user password when prompted.

2. **Get SharePoint Site Storage Size:**
   - To retrieve the size of a SharePoint site collection, run the following cmdlet:
     ```powershell
     Get-SPOSite
     ```
   - This will display the storage quota, current storage usage, and other details for the specified site.

3. **Get Storage Capacity of a Single SharePoint Site:**
   - If you want to get the storage capacity of a specific SharePoint site, use the following code (replace the placeholders with your actual AdminSiteURL and SiteURL):
     ```powershell
     # Config Parameters
     $AdminSiteURL = "https://your-tenant-admin.sharepoint.com"
     $SiteURL = "https://your-tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite"

     # Get Credentials to connect to SharePoint Admin Center
     $Cred = Get-Credential

     # Connect to SharePoint Online Admin Center
     Connect-SPOService -Url $AdminSiteURL -Credential $Cred

     # Get the Site collection
     $Site = Get-SPOSite $SiteURL

     # Display storage information
     Write-Host "Allocated: " $Site.StorageQuota
     Write-Host "Used: " $Site.StorageUsageCurrent
     Write-Host "Warning Level: " $Site.StorageQuotaWarningLevel
     ```
   - This script will provide the allocated storage quota, current storage usage, and storage quota warning level for the specified site.

Remember that the maximum storage size limit for a SharePoint site by default is **25TB**. You can also set custom storage limits if neededÂ¹Â². Happy PowerShell scripting! ðŸš€
